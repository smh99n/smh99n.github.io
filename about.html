<h3>About <strong>Me</strong></h3>
<body>
<p>Hello, my name is Sophie Hayes and I am currently a <em>freshman</em> at the University of Missouri. I am a General Studies major and I am able to graduate by the time I am a sophomore, 2023.<br/>However, I have chosen to get a minor in Information Technologies and certificates in Global Studies as well as Textile and Apparel Management. This will make my graduation date in May 2024. General Studies major is a route where you can make your major specialized to you if you don't find a major that is the right fit for you.With my General Studies degree I will be specializing in Digital Media Marketing.</p>
