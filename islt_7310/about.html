    <h1>Sophie Hayes</h1>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hello, my name is Sophie Hayes! I am currently a freshman attending the university of Missouri as a general studies major.
      I plan to create my own major that falls under the category of digital media marketing. I am involved in the sorority Kappa 
      Alpha Theta and I love being in such a big and welcoming group. I chose Mizzou because of the campus and the academics. When 
      I am not studying or participating in Greek Life things I am hanging out with friends and exploring all the things to do in 
      Columbia. I really enjoy traveling with family and playing tennis whenever I get the chance and I hope to be able to travel 
      abroad at some point in the next four years. For work, I nanny part time and I run my own Instagram account selling custom 
      college gear!</p>
        <h5>Education Overview</h5>
        <p>I am currently a freshman at the University of Missouri. I am a General Studies major and I am able to graduate by the 
              time I am a sophomore, 2023. However, I have chosen to get a minor in Information Technologies and certificates in 
              Global Studies as well as Textile and Apparel Management. This will make my graduation date in May 2024. General Studies 
              major is a route where you can make your major specialized to you if you don't find a major that is the right fit for you. 
              With my General Studies degree I will be specializing in Digital Media Marketing.</p>
