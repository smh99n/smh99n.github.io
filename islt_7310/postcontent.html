<h1>Post your content!</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <div id=aboutme><p>After your account is set up and all of your information is keyed in, it is time to post your content. This is not as simple as just posting pictures 
        of the items you're selling or offering. Well, I guess it can be as simple as that, but you will not be as successful. You should always make sure you have 
        high quality ad high resolution photos of your product. Not only this, but you should edit each picture in a certain way, so they all look like the 
        same aesthetic at first glance. How your page looks at first glance is how you will attract most customers.

        <div id="steps"><h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Take professional pictures of your product. If you don’t have the money to go above and beyond and higher someone, that is totally okay! 
            Even doing something as simple as staging a product on a white bed sheet and using natural lighting will give
             the product a cleaner look. You should make sure each picture is different 
             and there is a lot of variety. This will make your viewers take a double take.</p>
        <div id="steps"><h3>Step 2</h3>
         <p>Add the same filter on all of the images. When picking a filter, you want to make sure
            the lighting goes with the product your selling. For example, if you’re selling smiley face
            tumblers, you aren’t going to want to use dingy lighting. Once you find the filter you want to 
            use make sure you save it and add it to every photo you post. This will make your page look a lot more professional, organized, and appealing.
            </p>
            <div id="steps"><h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Post the picture. It is very important to watch when your audience is most active and post at those specific times. Instagram business 
                    profile will give you these statistics for you to follow. You also want to make sure to not post too many pictures at once. This 
                    can overwhelm your followers feed. At the beginning of your account however, it is okay to post a large amount before you have any 
                    followers so that your account will be ready when the time comes to get followers.</p>
