     Hello, my name is Sophie Hayes. I am currently a freshman at the University of Missouri, and I am a General Studies Major. I am minoring in information technology and so I have taken a couple classes already about web application and development. My expectation for this course is to get an A and understand the basics of coding. With the web development skills, I learn through this course I hope to be able to apply them to nay future job I have. Since my minor is information technology I plan to go into a career where these skills are necessary. When I am not doing schoolwork, I love to hang out with my friends or go shopping. When I hang out with my friends we are usually outside whenever the weather is nice just enjoying the day. My favorite hobby is going to thrift stores and upcycling clothing to sell on my Instagram account.
