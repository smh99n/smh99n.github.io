<h1>Find your followers!</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <div id=aboutme><p>When you are running an online business from Instagram you have to consider your followers as your "customers". These are the people that 
        are seeing all of your post and will potentially buy your products. However, followers don't just come randomly you should start by following people you 
        think might be interested in your product. You might find your audience by interacting and following users that follow other accounts like yours. This is a 
        great way to get a follower base started and then depending on how much business you get you might see your followers start to bring others to your page!

  </p></div>

        <div id="steps"><h3>1)	Follow some of your friends and family</h3>
            <p>Start by following some of your close friends and family in hopes to get a head start on getting some referrals. When your family and friends 
                are notified about your new Instagram business, they might want to support you by trying your products or by showing others around them your page.</p>
        <div id="steps"><h3>2)	Find other accounts like yours</h3>
         <p>By finding other accounts like yours you can follow some of the users following the similar pages. This might attract them to your page and bring you 
             some business. This is a great way to reach out to your target audience and bring them to interact with your account.
            </p>
            <div id="steps"><h3>3)	Watch the users follow you back</h3>
                <p>By taking initiative and following all these people first it will help speed along the process of finding your audience for your account. On Instagram it is very likely if you follow someone, they
                    will follow you back, so a lot of businesses on the app follow this tactic.
